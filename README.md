![EvoOpt Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19692103/58713060-1de5bc00-83c2-11e9-8213-bf69e3382321.jpg)

Python implementation of state-of-art meta-heuristic and evolutionary optimisation algorithms. 

** This library is implemented in Numpy (which was written in C) for fast processing speed**



# Current support for algorithms:

[x] Genetic Algorithm

[x] Duelist Algorithm

[ ] Particle Swarm Optimization

[ ] Multi-Verse Optimization

[ ] Grey-Wolf Optimization


# WORK IN PROGRESS
