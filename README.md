Python implementation of state-of-art meta-heuristic and evolutionary optimisation algorithms. 

** This library is implemented in Numpy (which was written in C) for fast processing speed**



# Current support for algorithms:

[x] Genetic Algorithm

[x] Duelist Algorithm

[X] Particle Swarm Optimization

[X] Gravitational Search Algorithm

[X] Firefly Algorithm

[ ] Multi-Verse Optimization

[ ] Grey-Wolf Optimization
